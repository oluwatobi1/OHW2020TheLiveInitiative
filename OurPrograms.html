      <p class="card-text"> WORK TO EARN
The “Work2Earn” programme by The Live Initiative is targeted at deliberately improving, relentlessly
empowering and enabling indigent Nigerian youths eclipse their impending financial challenges by
adorning them with in-demand 21st century skills allowing them to not only be able to chase their
dreams and scale their paths out of poverty but also add value to the society and stay in school while
doing so.
Nigeria has the highest population of out of school children in the world, that coupled with a redundant
education system, a bureaucratic government and an unstable economy means majority of Nigerian
youths can not only afford school, they are also trained with outdated methods and syllabuses which
undermine their ability to create wealth and are always denied opportunities if and when any exists.
Meaning it’s impossible for them to be self-reliant so they spend the majority of their productive years
battling poverty instead of outgrowing it.
In its inception, the “Work2Earn” programme fortified 20 young Nigerians with in demand skills,
leadership trainings, wealth creation and management sessions and it effected an immeasurable level of
transformative change in the finances, interpersonal communication and personal life of not only these
young people but also their families, friends, communities etc.
At The Live Initiative, we understand that the future of Nigeria lies in the values, productivity and
capability of its youth population and we are overly and dutifully committed in ensuring a fulfilling,
rewarding and poverty-free future for the next generation of Nigerian youths by ensuring that they have
the right values and that at least “everyone has a skill”</p>
