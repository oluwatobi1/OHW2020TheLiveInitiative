        <h2>About Us</h2>
      
    <p>
      A year before the United Nations Social Development Goals were signed in 2015, 276 bright,
      young and smart girls were abducted from their schools in Borno state Nigeria. Five years down
      the line, 112 of them are still in their captive's den, the success of insurgents in Northeast
      Nigeria has vastly increased, Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world and the youth
      unemployment index continues to grow annually resulting in youths turning to obscene ways
      such as cybercrime.
      That apart, Nigeria has the highest number of out of school children in the world with about a
      quarter of the population underemployed or unemployed and living in abject poverty. These
      terrifying happenings have left a sad and immeasurable level of unsavory experiences and
      undeserved realities on the lives of Nigerians whether young or old.
      At the Live Initiative, we are at odds with the level at which this has been accepted. We believe
      that every Nigerian should be able and enabled to have a good and comfortable life.
      When the Live Initiative was created in 2019, it was created out of sheer willingness and
      determination of a young and brilliant Nigerian lady whose aggravated frustrations of what is
      now know and has been accepted as the norm inspired what she believes will significantly
      redirect the purpose, revamp the lives and change the realities of underprivileged Nigerians.
      Today, herself and her team are intensively trying to overlap the lines and gaps between
      abilities, capabilities and opportunities among the rich and the poor in the Nigerian society.
      This is The Live Initiative.</p>
