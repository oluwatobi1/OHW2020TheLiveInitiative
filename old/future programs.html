TLI : REBIRTH
When a Nigerian prisoner Cliton Kanu was acquitted in 2019,he had spent 27 years of his life in prison
for a crime he did not commit. 13 of those he spent awaiting trial and the remaining 14 appealing and
explaining his innocence to a slow and usually nonchalant judiciary system. Like Cliton, many of Nigerian
prisoners have been detained and jailed for crimes they didn’t commit, majority are victims of an
irrational and corrupt police system that puts the love for money before the chase for to hunt real
monsters, this is evidenced by the recent surge in police brutality, illegal arrest and harassment by the
police and especially members of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS.
The 27 years Cliton spent in prison, he spent with 4000 prisoners who were held in an 850 capacity
prison. Overcrowded, unsanitary and abandoned. Those few words mildly describe the condition of
prisons in Nigeria today. According to the Network of University Legal Aid Institution, 70 percent of
prisoners in Nigeria are awaiting trial, more than half of whom are under the age of 30.
At the Live Initiative, while we believe that people should be held accountable for their misdeeds, we
strongly believe that there is good in every Nigerian and no one deserves to be condemned to the life
majority of prisoners have been, we also believe that no human being deserves to be convicted for
crimes they did not commit, or worse still not be allowed to prove their innocence within a short and logical time.Through our REBIRTH programme, we are hoping to help these young people unlearn the diminishing
self-narratives they have grown up to believe about themselves , help them learn to value and
appreciate themselves while also equipping them with skills that can help them provide for themselves
and for their families and give them a sense of direction once they finish serving their time.
TLI : DOYEN
The plight of widows in Nigeria is overly pathetic, from losing their beloved spouses to immediately
losing their homes, properties and belongings to vicious and opportunistic family members, the fight to
stay afloat after being widowed is always a brutally unfair one to the Nigerian widow. That apart,
majority of them are either unemployed, uneducated or unskilled, meaning that they are evidently
unable to be self-reliant. Stigmatization and rejection by society forced by tradition and beliefs further
blurs the realities of these widows and mothers whose new fortunes mean they can barely fend for
themselves or their immediate families and most times have their children drop out of school. This is the
reality of 3.5 million Nigerian women who according to the World Widow report have been widowed,
for many of these women the trauma from their loss and the unfortunate challenges that results after
usually translate into depression, medical related problems such as hypertension and in most cases ,
death.
We at The Live Initiative, through our “DOYEN” programme are trying to better the living conditions of
widows by empowering them with marketable survival skills to scale their finances and spending power
in an harsh economy like ours. We are also committed to networking and connecting them in order to
provide them an avenue to share their stories, scale above stigmatization and help them avoid
loneliness which could deteriorate their mental health or lead to depression.</p>
