<p><b>Our Vision</b><br />
Legendary poet Jonathan Swift once said “Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others”.
Many times greatness is invisible, most people think it’s a characteristic that’s only exclusive to
a set of privileged people.<br/> At the Live Initiative , we disagree. That’s why our vision is :<b>
To make great Heroes and Heroines out of every underprivileged Nigerian.</b></p>
