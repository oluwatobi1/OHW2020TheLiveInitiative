      <p class="lead">
        Legendary poet Jonathan Swift once said <strong>“Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others”.</strong> <br>
        Many times greatness is invisible, most people think it’s a characteristic that’s only exclusive to
        a set of privileged people.<br/> At the Live Initiative , we disagree. That’s why our vision is :<b>
        To make great Heroes and Heroines out of every underprivileged Nigerian.</b>
